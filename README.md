Housing Market Analysis by Zip Code
This project conducts an in-depth time series analysis on housing prices across various zip codes. Utilizing the SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, we aim to forecast future housing prices and evaluate the model's performance through dynamic predictions. The overarching goal is to identify trends, seasonality, and potential investment opportunities in the housing market.
